# C++ Student Records

This project is a demonstration of the use of circular linked lists. With linked lists I was able to make records of students
storing their general information. Manipulating the Nodes in the linked lists I was also able to manipulate the records of the students. 

## Features (Student Information)
- Age
- ID #
- Name
- Grade

Each student is individually added to the records and are given their own unique ID #. With this ID # we are able to remove them from the records. 
The records can also be displayed where we can see the active students, while also giving the option to make any changes. 
When browsing the records and have reached the end, the records will display in a different color signifying all students have been seen.
